			<p> I work as a Code Coach at the Coder School Berkeley. I develop lesson plans and use dynamic and project-based instruction to teach computer science to kids in a semi- private lesson format. Most of my students work with Snap, which was developed at Cal, or are learning Python. My goal is to foster an engaging and inclusive environment to inspire kids from all backgrounds to pursue computer science.</p>
